Car Driving Simulator, what started off as something that I coded during classes when I was bored which I then shared to my friends which loved it (i dunno why)


Now I'm making a sequel because I don't have the motivation to sift through all that spagetti and mess of CDS 1. Heck, the backdrops are like 15 MB for some reason. A 480x360 image.


Welp, hopefully making the actual car will be easy. This is a lot more complicated than CDS 1

I wonder what happens if I put this in the SB3

You cannot, it gets deleted by scratch
