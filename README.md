## Welcome to Car Driving Simulator 2 or CDS2 for short!

### Backstory
Car Driving Simulator started as a simple scratch project made in 2018 with zero knowledge of programming.

It can be found here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/311364999

It *is* kinda an unoptimized mess, each background is like 15 MB. I made a change locally and fixed that, but have been too lazy to publish it on Scratch.

### How to run

Clone the repo and run `sb3-repackage.py`

Then, you can run the resulting sb3 in TurboWarp Desktop (I have yet to decide if I will build this for TW or Scratch)

### Current State

First ~~Second?~~ commit, nothing has been done yet. Stay tuned!
