## Welcome to Car Driving Simulator 2 or CDS2 for short!

### Backstory
Car Driving Simulator started as a simple scratch project made in 2018 with zero knowledge of programming.

It can be found here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/311364999

It *is* kinda an unoptimized mess, each background is like 15 MB. I made a change locally and fixed that, but have been too lazy to publish it on Scratch.

### How to run

Clone the repo and run `sb3-repackage.py`

Then, you can run the resulting sb3 in **TurboWarp Desktop**
- Note: This cannot be run on scratch due to custom plugins
    - This can be run on Nitrowarp or whatever it's called, all TW plugins are compatible
        - I will not be testing a NW build though, so run at your own risk



### Controls

`J` - Start/Stop Engine

`W` - Press Accelerator Pedal
`S` - Press Brake Pedal
`.` - Press Clutch Pedal

`O` - Shift to Park
`P` - Shift to Neutral
`[` - Downshift / Shift to Drive (Auto)
`]` - Upshift

To start the car, the clutch needs to be held as it has a manual transmition and the car needs to be in neutral. After that, all the realism ends.

You can change to automatic in the settings 

## Current State
Other cars render now, but there is no objective yet
