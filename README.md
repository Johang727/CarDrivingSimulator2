## Welcome to Car Driving Simulator 2 or CDS2 for short!

### Backstory
Car Driving Simulator started as a simple scratch project made in 2018 with zero knowledge of programming.

It can be found here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/311364999
- Note: CDS 1 *is* kinda an unoptimized mess, each background is like 15 MB. I made a change locally and fixed that, but have been too lazy to publish it on Scratch.

### How to run

Download the latest artifact from the [Actions](https://github.com/Johang727/CarDrivingSimulator2/actions) tab!
- This should be a .zip named `sb3-output`
    - Located in the .zip should be CarDrivingSimulator2.sb3

Then, you can run the resulting sb3 in [**TurboWarp**](https://turbowarp.org/)
- Note: This cannot be run on scratch due to custom plugins
    - This can be run on NitroBolt, all TW plugins are compatible
        - I will not be testing a NB build though, so run at your own risk


### Controls

`J` - Start/Stop Engine

`W` - Press Accelerator Pedal
`S` - Press Brake Pedal
`.` - Press Clutch Pedal

`A` - Move Left
`D` - Move Right

`Q` - Left Indicator
`E` - Right Indicator
`Z` - Hazard Lights
`F` - Light


`I` - Shift to Park (Auto)
`O` - Shift to Reverse
`P` - Shift to Neutral
`[` - Downshift / Shift to Drive (Auto)
`]` - Upshift

To start the car, the clutch needs to be held as it has a manual transmition and the car needs to be in neutral. After that, all the realism ends.

You can change to automatic in the settings 

## Current State
Ehh, i guess there's somewhat of an objective. Gas station exists now.
