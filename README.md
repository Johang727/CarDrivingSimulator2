## Welcome to Car Driving Simulator 2 or CDS2 for short!

### Backstory
Car Driving Simulator started as a simple scratch project made in 2018 with zero knowledge of programming.

It can be found here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/311364999

It *is* kinda an unoptimized mess, each background is like 15 MB. I made a change locally and fixed that, but have been too lazy to publish it on Scratch.

### How to run

Clone the repo and run `sb3-repackage.py`

Then, you can run the resulting sb3 in **TurboWarp Desktop**
- Note: This cannot be run on scratch due to custom plugins
    - This can be run on Nitrowarp or whatever it's called, all TW plugins are compatible
        - I will not be testing a NW build though, so run at your own risk

### Current State

Engine is mostly complete, just need to actually do something with it.
